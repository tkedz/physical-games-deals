# physical-games-deals

Next.js 16 + Supabase. A collector of physical game releases; deals are extracted with an LLM from human-written RSS posts.
Context: @context/foundation/prd.md, @context/foundation/tech-stack.md, @context/foundation/lessons.md

## Language

Write every project artifact in English: code comments, documentation, README files, configuration comments, commit messages and PR descriptions. Keep this rule even when the conversation is in Polish — the prompt language does not change the artifact language.

The exception is `context/`: the product-thinking documents there (`prd.md`, `shape-notes.md`, `tech-stack.md`) stay in Polish. Do not translate them, and write new ones in Polish too. `context/foundation/lessons.md` is the one file in that directory kept in English, because review skills quote its rules verbatim.

## Next 16 — not the Next.js you know

- Before writing code that touches a framework API, read the relevant file in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` — see @AGENTS.md.
- The `middleware` convention is called **`proxy`** here: the file is `src/proxy.ts` and it exports `proxy()`, not `middleware()`. Do not create `middleware.ts`.

## Supabase

- Three clients: @src/utils/supabase/client.ts ("use client"), @src/utils/supabase/server.ts (Server Components / Actions / Route Handlers), @src/utils/supabase/session.ts (for `src/proxy.ts` only). Supabase's own docs call that last one `utils/supabase/middleware.ts`.
- Call `createClient()` from `server.ts` fresh on every request. Never hold the result in a module-level variable — session cookies are per-request.
- In @src/utils/supabase/session.ts, do not move `await supabase.auth.getUser()` and do not return anything other than `supabaseResponse`. Failure mode: random logouts. The reason is spelled out in that file's comments.
- The public key is `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` (not `..._ANON_KEY`). `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY` bypasses RLS and **never** takes the `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix. Full list: @.env.example
- Per-user data isolation rests on Postgres RLS, not on filtering in application code.

## Database migrations

- The schema lives in `supabase/migrations/` and is applied by hand. The loop is `npm run db:new -- <name>` → `npm run db:push -- --dry-run` → `npm run db:push` → `npm run db:check`. Use the npm scripts, not the bare CLI: they carry the flags, and `supabase db advisors` without `--fail-on error` exits 0 while printing the very finding it was hired to catch.
- From a clean checkout the CLI is unlinked. `npx supabase login`, then `npx supabase link --project-ref <ref>`. Both are interactive and belong to a human — `link` asks for the database password, which is not in this repository and must not be read out of `.env.local` (see **Secrets**).
- `npm run db:push` is a human action, never CI. No credential that can write the database belongs in a workflow.
- Every new table in `public` ships locked: `enable row level security` plus `revoke all on table <t> from anon, authenticated`, and no policy. Add a policy only when a browser client genuinely needs the rows, and justify it in the migration. Leave `service_role` alone — that is the server-side write path.
- Open every migration with two header lines: `-- Revert: <the statement that undoes this>` and a one-line statement of whether it is backward-compatible with the previous deployment. `vercel rollback` moves traffic only and does not undo a migration, so a migration must stay compatible for the length of one rollback window.
- Migrations are additive. A change that drops a column, narrows a type or adds `not null` to an existing one splits in two: the additive half now, the destructive half in a later migration, once the deployment that needed the old shape is no longer a rollback target. `supabase migration down` is not an escape — it resets rather than reverts, and takes the data with it.
- `npm run db:status` is the drift check between the repository and the hosted project. Manual apply makes drift possible; this is what detects it.
- Do not set `auto_expose_new_tables` in `supabase/config.toml`. It governs only the local stack, so it would hide a forgotten `revoke` exactly where mistakes are cheap and expose it where they are not. The `revoke` in the migration behaves the same in both places.

## Directories

- `_incoming/` is a staging directory listed in `.gitignore` — do not import from it into `src/` before deciding where the code finally belongs (@_incoming/README.md).
- The current PRD is `context/foundation/prd.md`; `prd_old.md` is stale.

## Verification

- `npm run lint` runs `eslint --max-warnings 0` (flat config) — the flag is deliberate, do not drop it. `npm run format:check` runs Prettier. Both make up the `verify` gate in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`; `deploy` does not start until they pass.
- There is no test runner and no tests. Do not claim tests passed — verify with `npm run build`, `npm run lint` or `npm run format:check`.

## Commits

- Do not add `Co-Authored-By` trailers, "Generated with" lines, or any other attribution to commit messages or pull request descriptions.
- Keep the subject line short and imperative. Add a body only when the change needs a reason the diff does not show.

## Secrets

- Never read `.env.local`, or any other file holding credentials, by any route: not with the Read tool, and not indirectly through `cat`, `node -e`, a script, or any other shell command. The `Read(.env.local)` deny rule in `.claude/settings.json` only covers the Read tool — this rule covers every path to the file, because a permission pattern cannot constrain an interpreter.
- To learn whether a variable is set, ask the user. Do not read the file to find out.
- Never print a secret, or any part of one, into the conversation — that includes prefixes, lengths and fragments.

## 10xDevs AI Toolkit - Module 2, Lesson 4

Prepare for a harder implementation stream with the **research-backed planning chain**:

```
internal research (/10x-research) + external research (exa.ai, Context7) -> /10x-plan -> /10x-implement -> success
```

The lesson focus is distinguishing internal from external research and using evidence to back planning decisions.

### Task Router - Where to start

| Skill | Use it when |
| --- | --- |
| **Internal research (lesson focus)** | |
| `/10x-research <change-id>` | You need evidence from the existing codebase — patterns, conventions, integration points, or existing implementations. Runs parallel sub-agents over the repo and writes structured findings to `research.md`. |
| **External research (lesson focus)** | |
| exa.ai | You need AI-native web search for library comparisons, best practices, or ecosystem context that the codebase cannot answer. |
| Context7 (`resolve-library-id` → `get-library-docs`) | You need live, current documentation for a specific library or framework. Resolves a library ID first, then fetches relevant doc pages. |
| **Framing spare wheel** | |
| `/10x-frame <change-id>` | The plan won't converge, the plan doesn't deliver expected results, or persistent drift keeps breaking the implementation. Use as an escape hatch on a separate problem (demonstrated on Space Explorers example), not as pre-research ritual. |
| **Planning and execution** | |
| `/10x-plan <change-id>` / `/10x-implement <change-id> phase <n>` | Use the same planning and execution chain from Lesson 2, now with upstream research evidence feeding the plan. |

### Research discipline

- Internal research (`/10x-research`) answers "what does our codebase already do?" — patterns, schemas, conventions, integration points.
- External research (exa.ai, Context7) answers "what should we do?" — library capabilities, API docs, ecosystem best practices.
- Combine both as evidence-backed input to `/10x-plan`. A plan without research evidence on a non-trivial stream is a guess.
- Agent-friendly docs (`llms.txt`, markdown-for-agents, `/md` endpoints) are a quality signal for library selection — libraries that publish agent-readable docs integrate faster.

### `/10x-frame` as spare wheel

Three triggers for reaching for `/10x-frame`:
1. The plan won't converge — research keeps opening more questions instead of narrowing to a contract.
2. The plan doesn't deliver — implementation repeatedly fails to meet success criteria.
3. Persistent drift — the implementation keeps diverging from the plan in ways that suggest the problem was mis-framed.

Demonstrated on a Space Explorers example, not the SRS path. It is an escape hatch, not a mandatory step.

### Paths used by this lesson

- `context/changes/<change-id>/research.md` - internal research output
- `context/changes/<change-id>/frame.md` - framing output when needed
- `context/changes/<change-id>/plan.md` - evidence-backed implementation contract
- `context/foundation/lessons.md` - recurring rules and pitfalls

Skills must not write to `context/archive/`. Archived changes are immutable; if a resolved target path starts with `context/archive/`, abort with: "This change is archived. Open a new change with `/10x-new` instead."
